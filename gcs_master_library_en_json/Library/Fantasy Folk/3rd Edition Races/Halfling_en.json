Otherwise they look exactly like humans. Halflings are\r typically plump, fair-skinned, round-cheeked, and curly-haired, and can be easily mistaken for a human child on first meeting. They rarely grow mustaches,\r and beards are almost unknown. Their demeanor is pleasant, and few are\r remarkably ugly or especially attractive. One unique feature of the Halflings is\r their broad, sturdy feet. They prefer to go barefoot, except in fierce weather or\r rough country. They wear simple but brightly-colored clothing according to the\r current human fashions."}}}}}
