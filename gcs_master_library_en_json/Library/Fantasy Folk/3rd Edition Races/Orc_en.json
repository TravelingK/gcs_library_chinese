Their arms are long and powerful, their legs are bowed, and\r their hands and feet are broad and coarse. Their skin is dark with a leathery texture. Though not furred, their bodies are much hairier than the average\r human\u2019s. Curiously, the hair on their head is sparse, short and wiry. Few Orcs\r have any sort of facial hair. Hair colors other than black are very rare. Most\r Orcs wear grimy hides and furs, though slaves go naked and leaders wear crude\r armor and perhaps a few pieces of barbaric finery."}}}}}
