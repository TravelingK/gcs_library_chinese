Many\r Goblins of both sexes are completely hairless. When a Goblin does have hair,\r it\u2019s dark, wiry, and grows only on the very top of the head. Their heads are\r extremely elongated, with high foreheads and pointed chins. The rest of their\r bodies are quite human, though their nails are long, sharp and clawlike. They\r stand about 5!\u20442 feet tall (height is normal for their ST, weight is 10 pounds less)\r and wear clothing according to local fashion."}}}}}
