Weight is negligible - 1 or 2 pounds.  Their wings are translucent and colourful, configured like those of a butterfly.  Otherwise they appear exactly like slender, beautiful humans.  Their complexions are usually fair, as is their hair colour.  They wear beautiful, minutely detailed costumes"}, "n3BuMaXvd539y2Kce": {"text": "Because of their small size, Ellyllon combat is unique in several ways.  Ellyllon lances do damage as large knives, spears as small knives (held or thrown), swords as daggers, and arrows as blowpipe darts.  Their armour is remarkably strong and well-made, but is still -1 DR due to its light construction (the race is considered to know certain secrets of Armoury which don't apply at larger scales; these prevent the penalty from being any greater).  In order to compensate for these disadvantages all Ellyllon get a +2 to any attempt to hide, and +3 to any Stealth roll.  These special conditions are considered to be \"special effects\" of the race's size.  Though significant, they are considered to roughly balance each other, and therefore carry no specific point costs."}}}}}
