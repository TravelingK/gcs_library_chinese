Half-Elves can pass for human, but\r\nare usually easily distinguishable from Elves. When a Half-Elf breeds with a\r human or another Half-Elf, the offspring are human, though often quite graceful\r\nand attractive; when he breeds with an Elf the offspring are Half-Elven. Half-Elves\r are usually welcome among both races. Half-Elves are rare, and many of them –\r not feeling at home in either culture – turn to a life of wandering and adventure."
