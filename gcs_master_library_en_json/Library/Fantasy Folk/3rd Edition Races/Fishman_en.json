Their heads are\r their most inhuman parts, with large, black, unlidded eyes, no nose, a broad,\r lipless mouth, and ears made up of sharp spines connected by webbing. A\r webbed, spined crest runs from the center of the forehead down the back of the\r neck. Fishman flesh is always a shade of green, from very pale to almost black.\r Fishmen wear no clothes other than equipment harnesses or crude jewelry."}}}}}
