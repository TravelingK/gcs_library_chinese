Their upper bodies are somewhat larger than a normal human's (height is 8\" more than usual, weight is 8 times normal).  They have very little hair on their upper bodies, though their females often have long silky tresses.  Centaur sages customarily shave their heads. Their lower bodies can be black, brown, grey, dappled, strawberry or even palomino.  Centaurs have no nudity taboo, but often wear clothing on their vulnerable human half for protection, warmth or decoration.  For some reason they seldom wear hats.  They never wear anything on their lower bodies (except, perhaps, a blanket when it's *very* cold).  The thought of wearing a saddle, harness or yoke is particularly odious to a Centaur."}}}}}
