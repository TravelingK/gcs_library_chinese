They are normally a beautiful people with glossy black hair, narrow faces and arched brows, and swarthy complexions.  They are taller than humans, but very slender (determine height and weight normally for ST, then add 6\").  Bales have two nonhuman traits - their pupils are slitted vertically, like a cat's, and their hands each have six long fingers, each with an extra joint.  Bales prefer rich but somber clothing after the human fashion.  They do not bear arms unless preparing for battle or while on a dangerous journey."}}}}}
