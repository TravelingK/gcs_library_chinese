In the wilderness, a typical hobgoblin owns nothing but a weapon (stolen or handmade) and some rags or ratty furs. They are brutal and direct but not as cruel or malicious as orcs. They speak either a human language or a pidgin version of the old goblin tongue. They have simple tastes. They like food and loot, and dislike anyone outside their immediate band.\n\nHobgoblins often have a tough time hanging on to wealth; many are Poor or worse, and very few have Miserliness. Some have more mental disadvantages, possibly including Intolerance. However, some have a higher IQ and lack Bad Temper or Stubbornness; they can be quite reasonable individuals, and often rise to positions of power within their band."}}}
