Most are just lone wanderers, haunting the wilderness and eating whatever\nthey can kill. Unlike, say, minotaurs, ogres have no particular innate hostility to other races. In the wild, they will react normally to chance encounters unless they are hungry. However, few people wait to see if an ogre wants to be friends. Ogre personalities are as one would expect from large, stupid humans; some are sullen, some just want to be liked. Most enjoy fighting.\n\nTo figure height, take ST before the +10 racial modifier, and increase it by 60%. Average weight is 5 times that of a human of the same (pre-modifier) ST.\n\nSome ogres are smarter or more social than the norm, and a minority understand that eating other people is frowned upon. Unfortunately, many of them have a lot more mental disadvantages than listed here, including everything from Bad Temper to Sadism. A tiny number are much smarter than the norm; these ogre geniuses are likely to have Magery instead of Magic Resistance."}}}
