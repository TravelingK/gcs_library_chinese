Magic fascinates many goblins, and they respect mages. There are few mighty goblin wizards, but the race produces a remarkable number of hedge magicians and dabblers. They are great traders and merchants. They travel everywhere, trading where they travel, and wherever they go, a few settle down. There are no exclusively goblin nations in Ytarria, but they are the majority in several parts of Megalos, particularly in the Duchy of Yibyorak (p. 100).\n\nGoblins are small and slender; height is normal for their ST, but weight is 10 pounds less.\n\nMany but not all goblins have the quirk \u201cInterested in magic and mages.\u201d For some this is a Compulsive Behavior (Hang around with wizards). Goblins are quite likely to have the Talents of Business Acumen or\nSmooth Operator, and their most successful merchants do not have Impulsiveness."}}}
