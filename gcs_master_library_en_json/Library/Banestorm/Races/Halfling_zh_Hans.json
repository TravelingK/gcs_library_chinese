Halflings are stocky and round-faced; they almost never wear beards.\n\nThey react well to anyone who sets a generous table or offers to share his ale. Anyone who seems “wild” or “dangerous” will get a cool reception from a village halfling, though city-bred or adventuring cousins will be less timid. A bad reaction usually means snubs and closed doors rather than combat. Rare is the halfling who will attack someone who hasn’t threatened his life or home.\n\nHalflings are 1 1/2 feet shorter than normal humans of their ST but have normal weight for humans of their ST.\n\nMany halflings have an Addiction to tobacco; a small minority have Alcoholism. Some replace Chummy and Staid with Xenophobia. Many, even if they have no need for it, have higher levels of Silence."
