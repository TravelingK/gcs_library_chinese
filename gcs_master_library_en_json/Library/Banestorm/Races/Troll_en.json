They have horny, warty, greenish skins, features which look like a grotesque parody of humanity, and slender but powerful frames. They are native to Gabrook, although curiously, dwarven legends from long before the Banestorm speak of similar creatures. Trolls are dangerous predators (with appropriate senses and a surprising talent for stealth), but unlike the simple-minded, bullying ogres, trolls are solitary and misanthropic, even brooding. Some seem to terrorize other races because they resent anyone else enjoying themselves!\n\nThey do occasionally come together in small groups, to hunt, find mates, or exchange knowledge. (They tolerate other trolls badly, but better than they usually tolerate anyone else.) The common exception to this attitude is family loyalty; trolls are often protective of their relatives, and vengeful if they\u2019re hurt.\n\nTrolls are nocturnal by preference, like damp conditions, and are superlative swimmers and divers. Their ideal lair is an air-filled cave with its entrance underwater, but they can adapt to most environments; some have taken to living under bridges or even in urban sewers, from which they may have to be evicted by heroes.\n\nOthers dwell deep in gloomy forests. Most speak the language of the dominant culture in the area, although they generally talk very little.\n\nA few female trolls have Magery and marginally better intelligence, and know a few spells, which are passed down from mother to daughter. Amoral humans occasionally ally with such beings, and have taught them additional spells.\n\nTrolls are more annoyed than inconvenienced by pain, and recover from damage that doesn\u2019t actually kill them quite quickly, unless it was inflicted by acid, fire, or lightning. (Some flaunt scars caused by torches or fire spells, which are not sure death for a troll.) Contrary to some stories, though, they don\u2019t reassemble themselves if hacked to pieces (although they can occasionally reattach limbs which were severed by a clean cut \u2013 treat this as a special effect). Another popular but incorrect story is that they turn to stone in daylight."}}}
