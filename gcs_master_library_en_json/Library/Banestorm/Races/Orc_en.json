Most orcs are brutal and treacherous, and respect only force; whether living as primitive savages or disciplined legionaries, the strongest and most ruthless among them will usually lead. They enjoy revelry, the spoils of war, and dominating those weaker than themselves.\n\nOrcs return other races\u2019 hostility with interest. Many will gladly sacrifice their own lives for a chance to take a dwarf or elf with them.\n\nHeight is 2\u201d less than normal for ST. Weight is 10 lbs. over human average for their height.\n\nIndividual orcs, even whole tribes, often have the advantages Acute Vision, Combat Reflexes, High Pain Threshold, Night Vision, or Rapid Healing. Common disadvantages include Bad Temper, Berserk, Gluttony, Greed, Sadism, and Unattractive Appearance (though some orcs manage rugged good looks). However, civilized orcs do not usually have Intolerance and may even lack Bully."}}}
