This is represented by an abstract Size Modifier (SM). Any object can be assigned an SM to rate how hard it is to see from afar or hit in combat.\n\nNormal humans – from about 5’ to 6’6” in height – have an SM of 0. For other creatures and objects, consult this table:\n\nLongest Dimension   SM \n            2.5”               -9 \n            3.5”               -8 \n             5”                 -7 \n             7”                 -6 \n            10”                 -5 \n            18”                 -4 \n             2’                  -3 \n             3’                  -2\n            4’6”                -1\n            6’6”                 0\n             9’                  +1\n            15’                 +2\n            21’                 +3\n            30’                +4\n\nFor intermediate heights, use the next-higher value; e.g., 2’6” is SM -2. All this assumes an approximately human shape – just one long dimension. For an “elongated box” shape (e.g., a cart), add +1 to SM; for something like a cube or a sphere, add +2.\n\nA person with SM +1 or greater is easier to hit and may have problems fitting into rooms, vehicles, etc. meant for normal humans, but is often stronger and harder to kill than most humans. To reflect this, he gets 10% off the point cost of ST and HP per +1 SM (round all fractions up).\n\nSmaller-than-human characters (SM -1 or less) don’t modify these costs. The benefits and drawbacks of tiny size – such as being harder to hit but unable to use a lot of standard human gear – are considered to balance out. Such folk might have to take disadvantages that reflect their size, such as reduced Basic Move (p. 28) or Short Arms (p. 96), but that depends on the specific case.\n\nFinally, being larger is intimidating. When using Intimidation (p. 74), add your SM to your skill and subtract the target’s SM. However, you can’t get better than +4 this way; a 100’ giant isn’t that much more worrying than a 50’ giant.

You can pass for a normal mortal to casual observers, but closer inspection reveals that you are not quite right.\n\nSupernatural Features differ from Unnatural Features (p. 30) in that they aren’t usually obvious; they only become apparent under specific circumstances. When they are noticed, though, they give a reaction penalty: -1 for every -5 points from this trait. They also give a bonus to any skill roll made to identify your true nature: +1 for every -5 points.\n\nIf the features can only be detected on close contact and might pass as just slightly odd (e.g., No Body Heat), they’re worth -5 points. However, most are blatantly unnatural and fairly easy to spot in appropriate circumstances or good light (e.g., No Reflection in Mirrors, No Shadow, and Deathly Pallor), and are worth -10 points. Many traditional vampires have several different Supernatural Features.", "points_per_level": -5, "features": [{"type": "conditional_modifier", "situation": "", "amount": -1, "per_level": true}, {"type": "conditional_modifier", "situation": "", "amount": 1, "per_level": true}], "can_level": true, "levels": 3, "calc": {"points": -15}}, {"id": "tszELHXNmQoZqwABw", "name": "", "reference": "DW98", "userdesc": "You suffer painful physical injury from something that’s harmless to normal humans.
